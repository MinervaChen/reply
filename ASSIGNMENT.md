# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned to use the library by running some of the initial examples, writing my own examples, and reading through the code carefully. 
> One aspect that could definitely made reading the code easier is if the code was already commented. However, I felt that the way he structured
> the code made it very intuitive already and the naming was also intuitive. That hardest part was knowing what the parameters meant. 
> And what type (object, int, string, etc) the parameters were expected to be. After reading the code more thouroughly, you could figure it out, 
> but it would have been easier if it were commented better. 

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> It means that you should write things by telling the main points, but not having the comments dictate exactly what happens within the code
> If I had to explain this to a new cse 142 student, I would tell them to pretend that you are explaining your code in a business meeting. 
> Would you tell your managers or clients, etc that you used a forloop? probably not. You would skim over those details and just talk about
> what the method does, what parameters are expected, at a higher level sense. 

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 4 hours


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> no. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Yes. The jsdocs module was confusing to figure out. Hopefully we can get it more thoroughly explained? I had trouble getting it to work.
